# CS370-Current-Emerging-Trends-in-CS

## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself? ##

This project used neural networks, reinforcement learning, and Q-algorithms to create a pathfinding intelligent agent.  It is a pirate that must navigate through a maze with obstacles to reach a treasure at the end.

I was provided with the grid maze environment in the python class TreasureMaze.py.  I was given the class that stored all the episodes (all the states that come in between the initial state and the terminal state) for exploration as GameExperience.py.  TreasureHuntGame.ipynb came with the exploitation information, the neural network model, and the q-training algorithm with pseudocode.  The Q-learning algorithm had to be implemented.

## What do computer scientists do and why does it matter? ##

Computer scientists find solutions to problems.  This has benefits in all areas of society.  For this class, we discussed AI and machine learning, which can help within medical fields through diagnosis, customer service with resolutions, speech recognition with products like Alexa, and finance with predicting market outcomes.

## How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist? ##

I approach problems in pieces to ensure that all requirements are met according to the clientâ€™s specifications.  I debug throughout the process to ensure it is functional and secure.

## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization? ##

The ACM (Association for Computer Machinery) has a code of ethics and professional conduct that serves as the basis for ethical decision making.  Principles include contribute to society and to human well-being, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing, avoid harm, be honest and trustworthy, be fair and take action not to discriminate, respect the work required to produce new ideas, inventions, creative works, and computing artifacts, respect privacy, and honor confidentiality, among others.
